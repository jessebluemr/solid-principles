# S.O.L.I.D.

The principles shortly explained.

---

# History

SOLID principles came from an essay written
in 2000 by Robert Martin (Uncle Bob)

> A successful application will change and, without good design,
 can become rigid, fragile, immobile and viscous.

* _Rigid_: Things are very fixed. You can’t move or change things without affecting other things, but it’s clear what will break if you make a change.

* _Fragile_: Easy to move and change things but not obvious what else might break as a result.

* _Immobile_: Code works fine but you can’t re-use code without duplicating or replicating it.

* _Viscous_: Everything falls apart when you make a change, you quickly push it back together and get your change working. The same thing happens when somebody else comes along to make a change.

---

# History

To avoid the anti-patterns be S.O.L.I.D.

* _S_ ingle Responsibility
* _O_ pen/Closed Principle
* _L_ iskov’s Substitution Principle
* _I_ nterface Segregation
* _D_ ependency Inversion

<br/>

> Uncle Bob didn’t invent the principles,
he pulled together some good coding practices
that already existed around a central theme of managing dependencies
and put forward a good argument for using those practices together.

---

# Single Responsibility

> There should never be more than one reason for a class to change

__Bad Sample:__

```js
class Handler {
    handle(){
        var stuff = this.parse("./file.input")
        this.persistIntoDb(stuff);
    }

    parse(){ ... }

    persistIntoDB(records){ ... }
}
```

* Change required if input structure changes
* Change required if kind of persistence changes

__Better__: Extract "parse" and 'persistIntoDB' into independent classes.

---

# Single Responsibility

_How to adhere to the principle ?_

* Think about names
* Unit Tests
* Static code analysis:
  * Class length
  * Method length
  * Complexity depth

---

# Open / Closed Principle

> A module should be open for extension but closed for modification


---

# Liskov’s Substitution Principle

> Subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes

_Let q(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T._

.float_right[![](./out/liskov/liskov.svg)]

<br/>

Sample of [Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskovsches_Substitutionsprinzip):

'Is a' association between Circle and Ellipse is mathematical correct
but a circle is not allowed to be scaled on different axis.
The correctness of inheritance is highly coupled to the provided properties/methods of each subclass.

---

# Liskov’s Substitution Principle

_How to adhere to the principle ?_

* Avoid inheritance
* Be careful adding methods to super classes

---

# Interface Segregation

> Many client specific interfaces are better than one general purpose interface

__Bad Sample:__

.float_right[![](./out/interface_seg_bad/interface-segregation.svg)]

* Clients (Importer, Printer, Display) depend on 'Repositories' but:
    * Printer and Display need only the "reading" part
    * Importers need only the writing part
* From the view of the clients 'Repository' is the wrong abstraction
* Hard to apply e.g. Decorator Patterns or reuse 'Printers' for other 'DataSources'.

---

# Interface Segregation

__Better Sample:__

.float_right[![](./out/interface_seg/interface-segregation.svg)]

* Clients know now only what they need
* Composition patterns are now easier to apply
* Tests simpler to write

<br/>
<br/>

_How to adhere to the principle ?_

* Think about clients on interface design
* Single responsibility principle for interfaces

---

# Dependency Inversion

> Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions.

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, and details should depend on abstractions.

__Bad Sample:__

![](./out/di_bad/di.svg)

* Very high coupling
* Importer depends on concrete implementation

---

# Dependency Inversion

__Better Sample:__

.float_right[![](./out/di/di.svg)]

* Importer depends now on a 'Writer' abstraction
* Simpler to provide e.g. storage alternatives
* Simpler to write tests

<br/>
<br/>

_How to adhere to the principle ?_

* Unit Tests
* Think about names and abstractions

> Abuse: Introduce interfaces for any thing

---

# Summary

The aim of the SOLID principles is to reduce dependencies, enabling the ability to change code in one area of an application without impacting code in other areas.
